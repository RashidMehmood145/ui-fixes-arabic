							<h3 class="privacy-heading"><span class="privacy-intro-heading">Introduction: </span></h3>
							<p>Alistithmar Capital respects your rights to the privacy of any personal information you may supply to us when transacting business with us electronically. We are committed to providing a high level of security and privacy regarding collection and use of our online customer’s personal information.</p>
							<h3 class="privacy-heading "><span class="complaint-heading">Information Personal of use and collection, Exchange :</span></h3>
							<p>The electronic exchange of personal information is designed to maximize the protection of your internet relationship while enabling Alistithmar Capital to provide you with the products and services you are requesting. Any personal information collected by Alistithmar Capital is used solely for the purposes of providing you with investment services.</p>
							<p>The information we collect is used for several reasons, such as, authenticating your access to the services and to allow us to measure the performance and integrity of our services.</p>
							<p>Alistithmar Capital employees’ access to your personal and financial information is limited and is only provided such that those employees can provide you with the services and products that you require.</p>
							<p>Your personal and financial information are not shared with any third party, except where (1) the information is required in order to meet your instructions; (2) when you request or permit disclosure; or (3) when such disclosure is required by, or allowed by, law, governmental or regulatory considerations, subpoena or other legal processes such as fraud investigation or audit.</p>
							<h3 class="privacy-heading"><span class="privacy-exchange-heading">Information Personal of use and collection, Exchange :</span></h3>
							<p>“Cookies” may be used in electronic exchanges for the purpose of serving you better. A cookie is an element of data that the electronic service may send to your browser and which may be stored on your computer. Any “cookies” which are placed onto your computer are for identification, performance and integrity purposes only and serve no further functions.</p>
							<h3 class="privacy-heading "><span class="privacy-policy-heading">Policy Security Our : </span></h3>
							<p>We maintain security standards and procedures to help prevent any unauthorized access to your confidential information. We use a full range of systems security measures, including cryptography, filtering routers, intrusion detecting systems, virus detecting systems, firewalls, and trusted operating systems as part of our overall security architecture.</p>
							<p>Security of electronic information exchange begins with you and with your information exchange systems such as your Internet browser, your e-mail program and your telephone. The Alistithmar Capital anticipates that you will take every reasonable measure to protect yourself from exposure caused by inappropriate security, eavesdropping or intrusion.</p>
							<p>We take steps to protect your personal information, including accounts, transactions, user identities and passwords during the information exchange between you and Alistithmar Capital. For example, your Internet exchanges are protected by series of filtering routers and firewalls that act as a barrier between the outside world and our internal network. The filtering router is the first component that you pass through to gain access to your account information and is responsible for determining who has access to what information. The firewall is the next security component that your exchange of information passes through. The firewall provides a high level of security and authentication of your requests and our responses. It tracks each request that was made, who made it, when it was made, where it was made from and to where our response was destined. Each of those technologies is used to determine whether you are granted access to your requested information while protecting our internal company network from unauthorized outside access.</p>
							<p>Access to your account information, through internet trading or other electronic means, is protected with passwords known only to you. Your password must be used only by you when you access your accounts and when you request that transactions be executed on your behalf. The password is known only to you, so you can be confident that your data is secure provided that you take steps to safeguard your passwords and prevent these from becoming known to others.</p>
							<p>If you use the Internet to exchange information with Alistithmar Capital, you will be able to see when you are secured during information exchange, when a “locked” icon is displayed at the bottom of the screen or when https:// appears in the address line. This is often referred to as a ‘secured session’. You can increase your level of security by memorizing your password and by changing it regularly. You should try to avoid using passwords that can be guessed by people who know you or who have information about you – for example, avoid passwords that contain your birth date, your name or parts of your name, or that include any well-known values such as your phone number, your car registration, your customer or account number. If you must write down your password, please make sure you keep this written record securely stored.</p>
							<p>Alistithmar Capital is entitled to act on any instructions it receives using your password. When you give someone your password, you are authorizing that person to use our internet trading services as though that person were you. That person becomes your nominee. You remain fully responsible for all transactions performed using your password, even if you did not intend or authorize the nominee to act as you.</p>
							<p>No employee of Alistithmar Capital will ever ask you for your password, nor should you ever provide it to anyone in any context or for any reason. We do not ever want you to tell us your password</p>
							<h3 class="privacy-heading"><span class="privacy-security-heading">Policy Security Our : </span></h3>
							<p>Alistithmar Capital is not responsible for any virus or other malicious code that you may encounter using our electronic services. We encourage and require you to routinely scan your computer, e-mails and storage (such as memory, disks, diskettes) using industry recommended and recognized virus protection products. If undetected and un-repaired, a virus can corrupt and destroy your programs, files and hardware and can result in your confidential information being exposed.</p>
							<p>If you have any questions about your privacy or the accuracy of your account information at any time, or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please </p>
